This code is a part of my mini project which aims at showcasing use of various data structures. 
This is a program for a pizza store order desk having basic operations required.
The program makes use of following data structures for the respective operations - 
        - Queues to handle active orders (Placing / dispatching orders and displaying)
        - Linked lists to store previously dispatched orders.
        - Arrays to store data.
        - Stacks to keep a log of total sale of restaurant.
        - Binary search trees to store menu of the restaurant.
        
        
To run the program, download all the program files in a single folder and execute the " main.c " file.
