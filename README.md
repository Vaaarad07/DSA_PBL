# Overview
This was my mini project for Data structures course in the 3rd semester.The main aim of the project was to demonstrate hypothetical use-case and more importantly the implementation of various data structures.
The overall idea of the project is implementing various data structures to carry out some basic functionalities of a restaurant order-counter, like storing order details, dispatching orders, storing menu, printing orders and menu, keeping a track of sales.
### Following Data structures are used for respective functionalities:

- **Linked Lists** to store past orders
- **Queue** to store active orders
- **Trees** to store the menu card
- **Stack** to keep track of sales
